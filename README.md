# Credit_Risk_Analysis

### Overview of the analysis:
The purpose of this analysis was to utilize what we learned in Chapter 17 regarding Machine Learning to help Jill with a credit-risk model. Using imbalanced-learn and the scikit-libraries, we were able to build and evaluate six different machine learning models. 

We were provided with a dataset in the form a CSV file, titled "LoanStats_2019Q1." This data included, but was not limited to, the following information about loan applicants: loan amount, term, interest rate, emploloyee title, length of employment, home ownership status, annual income, purpose, and credit scores.

After evaluating the six models, the goal was to determine whether it could be used to evaluate credit risk.

### Results:
Using bulleted lists, describe the balanced accuracy scores and the precision and recall scores of all six machine learning models. Use screenshots of your outputs to support your results.

### Summary:
Summarize the results of the machine learning models, and include a recommendation on the model to use, if any. If you do not recommend any of the models, justify your reasoning.
